# Description

This cookbook installs the OpenResty NGINX bundle (http://www.openresty.org)
from source and sets up configuration handling similar to Debian's Apache2 scripts.
It also provides an OHAI plugin for configuration detection and an LWRP for easy site
activation and deactivation.

The latest and greatest revision of this cookbook will always be available
at https://github.com/priestjim/chef-openresty

# Requirements

## Cookbooks

The following cookbooks are direct dependencies because they're used
for common "default" functionality.

* build-essential
* ohai (for openresty::ohai_plugin)
* logrotate (for log file rotation)
* apt
* yum

In order to install the OpenResty `postgresql` module you'll also need
the `postgresql` cookbook.

If you want to link NGINX to the very performant jemalloc library, you'll
need the `jemalloc` cookbook.

## Platform

The following platforms are supported and tested using test-kitchen:

* Ubuntu 16.04
* CentOS 7.2

Other Debian and RHEL family distributions are assumed to work.

## Chef Server

The cookbook converges best on Chef installations >= 10.16.2

# Awesome stuff

This cookbook includes automatic activation of some nice NGINX features such as:

* **By default LUAJIT-enabled build**: The cookbook by default activates the LUAJIT
  feature of OpenResty (since this is the main reason to use the bundle) and
  accounts for all the peculiarities this option may bring.

* **Automatic CPU affinity**: Automatically sets the worker-to-core affinity for all
  of the NGINX worker processes. For a scenario of 8 workers and 8 cores, the
  following directive gets generated:

        worker_cpu_affinity 00000001 00000010 00000100 00001000 00010000 00100000 01000000 10000000;

  This feature can offer a nice performance boost, since it helps the CPUs maintain
  cache locality (especially when used in conjunction to the LUA module)

* **Automatic detection and activation of the AIO feature**: The cookbook automatically
  detects support (Linux kernel >= 2.6.22) and enables the `aio` directive of NGINX.

* **Automatic IPv6 detection and activation**: The cookbook automatically detects and
  activates IPv6 support on NGINX.

* **Support for custom PCRE runtime**: The cookbook can use custom PCRE sources in order
  to statically link to a custom-compiled PCRE runtime that supports JIT regular expression
  compilation which will significantly speed up RE execution in the NGINX and Lua environments.

* **Support for LUA Rocks**: The cookbook installs support for LUA Rocks embedded in the LUAJIT
  installation, allowing you to install any rock you want, right from the official Rocks site. It
  also provides an LWRP for installing rocks via your recipes.

# Attributes

Node attributes for this cookbook are logically separated into different files.

## default.rb

Generally used attributes. Some have platform specific values. See
`attributes/default.rb`. "The Config" refers to "nginx.conf" the main config file.

# Recipes

## default.rb

The default recipe will install the OpenResty NGINX bundle from source,
automatically including your selected set of modules, extra-cookbook modules and
set up the configuration according to the Debian site enable/disable style with
`sites-enabled` using the `nxensite` and `nxdissite` scripts provided by the
`openresty_site` LWRP.

The recipe ensures that the required packages to build NGINX are installed (pcre,
openssl, compile tools). The source will be downloaded from the
`node['openresty']['source']['url']`. The `node['openresty']['user']` will be
created as a system user. The appropriate configuration and log
directories and config files will be created as well according to the
attributes `node['openresty']['dir']` and `'node['openresty']['log_dir']`.

The recipe attempts to detect whether additional modules should be
added to the configure command through recipe inclusion (see below),
and whether the version or configuration flags have changed and should
trigger a recompile.

Many features are automatically detected and enabled into the NGINX default
configuration file such as AIO support for Linux kernels >= 2.6.22, IPv6 support
and CPU worker affinity.

The NGINX service can be either managed with SYSV init style scripts that are already included in
the cookbook or you can define your own. You only have to define the service resource used for
notifications (like `runit_service[nginx]` or `service[nginx]`) and optionally a recipe to be included
in the convergence flow (like `openresty::service_init` or `my_openresty:::service_runit`).

The cookbook generates various include files (.inc) that are available for inclusion
in standard NGINX site definition files via the `#include` directive. Look in the
`conf.d` directory of `node['openresty']['dir']` location for them!

Includes the `ohai_plugin` recipe so the plugin is available.

## ohai_plugin.rb

This recipe provides an Ohai plugin as a template. It is automatically included
by the `default.rb` recipe.

## http_*_module.rb, fair_module.rb, upload_progress_module.rb, cache_purge_module.rb

These recipes are automatically included by the `default.rb` recipe according to
the `node['openresty']['modules']` array and provide compiled-in additional
features to the standard OpenResty NGINX compile. Check each recipe separately
for more information.

## http_stub_status_module.rb

Special mention needs to be made for the stub status module. The approach followed
here is to create an _include_ file with proper directives (set in the
`status_module.rb` attribute file) that can be included in any NGINX configuration
virtual host via the include directive:

    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/nginx_status.conf.inc;

## luarocks.rb

The `luarocks` recipe installs the LUA rocks package management system for the
LUAJIT bundle that comes with OpenResty. You can define a set of rocks to install by
default using the `node['openresty']['luarocks']['default_rocks']` hash.

For more information on using LUA rocks with OpenResty check out http://openresty.org/#UsingLuaRocks

## Adding New Modules

To add a new module to be compiled into NGINX in the source recipe,
the node's run state is manipulated in a recipe, and the module as a
recipe should be added to `node['openresty']['modules']`. For
example:

    node.run_state['openresty_configure_flags'] =
      node.run_state['openresty_configure_flags'] | ["--with-http_stub_status_module"]

The recipe will be included by `recipe[nginx::default]` automatically,
adding the configure flags. Add any other configuration templates or
other resources as required. See the recipes described above for
examples.

In order to include extra-cookbook modules (most probably via an _application_
cookbook), you can use the `node['openresty']['extra_modules']` array,
which takes as elements full recipe references like

    'recipe[my_openresty::module_42istheanswerforeveryhing]'

The extra-cookbook modules will be included in the same manner as the standard
intra-cookbook modules.

# LWRP

## site

The cookbook includes the `openresty_site` LWRP (in contrast to the original
`nginx_site` cookbook definition script). The LWRP can be used in the same manner
as `nginx_site` and offers resource notifications (an advantage LWRPs
offer over simpler definitions). It also includes a `timing` parameter that can
be used to notify the `nginx` process to restart immediately based on configuration
file changes. It can also deploy your website's configuration in the appropriate place
if you define the `template` parameter with the filename of your website's configuration template
(variables for this template can be defined with `variables`) in the cookbook where you've also
defined the `openresty_site` resource. The LWRP can be used such as:

    openresty_site 'site.example.com' do
      template 'site.example.com.conf.erb'
      variables hostname: 'site.example.com'
      action :enable
      timing :immediately
    end

## luarock

The cookbook includes a LUA rock LWRP that allows for easy installation of LUA rocks,
available to use with the LUAJIT system bundled with OpenResty. You can install and remove
LUA rocks using the `install` and `remove` actions of the LWRP. A sample follows:

    openresty_luarock 'md5' do
      action :install
      version '1.1.2'
    end

    openresty_luarock 'luasql-mysql' do
      action :install
      environment {
        'MYSQL_DIR' => '/usr/local'
      }
    end

    openresty_luarock 'luafilesystem' do
      action :remove # Removes all versions installed
    end

# Ohai Plugin

The `ohai_plugin` recipe includes an Ohai plugin. It will be
automatically installed and activated, providing the following
attributes via ohai, no matter how NGINX is installed (source or
package):

* `node['nginx']['version']` - version of NGINX
* `node['nginx']['configure_arguments']` - options passed to
  ./configure when NGINX was built.
* `node['nginx']['prefix']` - installation prefix
* `node['nginx']['conf_path']` - configuration file path

The Ohai plugin is generally used to determine whether control
attributes for building NGINX have changed.

# Usage

Include the recipe on your node or role. Modify the
attributes as required in a role cookbook to change how various
configuration is applied per the attributes section above.

If you need to alter the location of various cookbook_file
directives, use `chef_rewind`.
